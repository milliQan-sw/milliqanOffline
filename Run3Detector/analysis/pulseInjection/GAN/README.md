In order to use the GAN: 
1. Create python virtual environment with `python -m venv <environment
   name>`
2. `source <environment name>/bin/activate.<bash, tcsh, fish, zsh>`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python -m pip install -e .` This is needed to do imports correctly
   within the files. 

All code should be ran from within the GAN directory in order to
ensure the correct pathing (ie. python src/main.py to run the main.py script)
