milliQanSim analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------

Files in this folder are to analysis the Flat simulatoin tree.
You can find the details for how generate the raw data at https://github.com/rtschmitz/milliQanSim/tree/main
The tree flattening script can be found at https://github.com/CollinKa/CreateSimFlattree


I create some analysis script for cosmic background analysis with the flat tree.




CosmicEventDebug.py: this file is used to get the details of the specified events in case you need to do some debugging.

withPhotonAnalysis.py: count the number of sim events that pass the geometric, NPE ratio and correct time cut for each event and print the results. The result will be collect to reconstruct the table 1 in https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.032002 with latest detector configuration. Event that pass correct time cut is rare, so I didn't write a script to do the counting. But you can mannualy count them by searching "signal like event" in output.

Usage: python3 withPhotonAnalysis.py > output.txt


summingResult.py: count the number of sim events that pass different cuts from all of the files. The event that can pass concecutive correct time is an interesting event. You can find them inside output.txt by searching "signal like event is found!"

offlineCheck1.py: check the result by applying the analysis to offline data


SimMuon_tag.py: find the events that matches the cosmic muon characteristic and then send the eventID and file ID to muonTagPlot.py to create histograms.




----------------------sample for using condor job------------------

for test

python3 SIMCondor.py -i /mnt/hadoop/se/store/user/czheng/SimFlattree/withPhotonMuontag/ -o /home/czheng/scratch0/SIManalysisDEV/milliqanOffline/Run3Detector/analysis/simAnalysis/condorTest/ -s layerConstrainDemo_job.py -t

 bash condor_wrapper.sh layerConstrainDemo_job.py 0 filelist.json locationForsavingFile

if thing is working fine then 
python3 SIMCondor.py -i /mnt/hadoop/se/store/user/czheng/SimFlattree/withPhotonMuontag/ -o /home/czheng/scratch0/SIManalysisDEV/milliqanOffline/Run3Detector/analysis/simAnalysis/condorTest/ -s layerConstrainDemo_job.py

------------------------sample for using bsub job(TBD ----------------
UCSB cluster doesn't come with uproot now
