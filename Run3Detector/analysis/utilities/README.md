Overview:
    This directory contains the main tools for processing milliqan offline trees including the milliqanProcessor. An overview of the main tools defining the milliqan analysis framework is given below.

milliqanProcessor:
    This class acts as a wrapper for the uproot iterate method. Inputs to the processor are: \
- filelist (required): list of input files for the processor to run over, these should be offline trees \
- branches (required): list of all branches from the offline files that are needed for the specific analysis \
- schedule (required): milliqanScheduler class instance containing a list of all cuts and plots that will be made \
- cuts (depreciated): milliqanCuts class instance passed directly to processor \
- plotter (depreciated): milliqanPlotter class instance passed directly to processor \
- max_events: max number of events that should be run over \
- qualityLevel: quality cut to require from the filelist \
    - override: allow all files \
    - loose: default trigger configs, file is well trigger and digitizer matched \
    - medium: loose requirements and 2 or fewer channels without pulses \
    - tight: loose requirements and no channels without pulses \
    - single_trigger: special run with single triggers only \
- verbosity: verbose output level for print outs from the processor (off, minimal, full) \
